# CS:GO Config
Based on Bananagaming a.k.a Maxim, this is my version of the best CS:GO config

This includes:
 1. Main important commands
 2. Custom Bindings
 3. Crosshair (You can find other crosshairs in the "cros.cfg" files)
 4. Hud for the best view experience
 5. Radar ajdustments
 6. Vitally mouse improvements
 7. Better Viewmodel
 8. Less weapon movement
 9. Network tweaks
10. Smaller netgraph
11. Performance tweaks
12. Sound imporvements
13. Disabled useless settings
14. Scripts (Jump+duck, Jump+throw, Advanced Bind Script, and more)
